> outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality
1. In the product detail page, we’d like to add a feature that allows users to view exactly what colors and sizes are selected. Before the user clicks on the add to bag button, we’d like our color and size buttons to be highlighted through the use of css/sass.
2. Within the product detail page, we’d like to fix a bug that currently populates two items at a time instead of just one. This bug is believed to be due to the useCart hook state and the function both rendering at the same time.
